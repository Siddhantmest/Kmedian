# Kmedian Implementation

This is the implementation of Kmedian analysis on the structured data. Kmedian analysis is useful if the distance between the data points is explained by **Manhattan distance or the distance metric is Taxicab**.
The Kmedian analysis minimizes the L1 norm thus, kmedian analysis minimizes the sum of absolute deviations, instead of the squared ones as done by Kmeans.
